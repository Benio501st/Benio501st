- ⚡ Fun fact: The 501st Legion, also known as "Vader's Fist," is one of the most renowned units in the "Star Wars" universe, with a rich history that extends from the Clone Wars into the era of the Empire.
  A fun fact about the 501st Legion is that it was not just a prominent group within the Star Wars narrative but also inspired the creation of a real-world organization known as the 501st Legion,
  which is a global fan club dedicated to constructing and wearing screen-accurate replicas of Imperial Stormtrooper armor, Sith Lords, Clone Troopers, bounty hunters,
  and other villains from the Star Wars universe.
